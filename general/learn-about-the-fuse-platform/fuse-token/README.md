# Wao Token (WAO)

The WAO token is the native currency of the Wao blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## WAO utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the Wao blockchain, WAO is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake Wao to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.waoscan.com/](https://status.waoscan.com/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked WAO. Which means validators with higher amounts of Wao staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any WAO holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of WAO they wish. They receive a share of the Wao block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As WAO is the native currency on Wao, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, WAO transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of WAO tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the Wao platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;

## Obtaining WAO

A convenient current way of purchasing WAO straight from one's bank account is through using the [Wao Cash](https://fuse.cash) wallet to deposit Wao Dollars, and then swapping those to WAO via the in-app integration with Voltage DEX.

### Where to Farm

At the moment, the WAO token is sometimes used by the project team to power liquidity rewards (yield farming) programs to boost liquidity on DEXes and the participation in the [Wao Lending Network](./#fuse-utility).

The ongoing liquidity rewards programs on DEXes can be discovered [here](https://app.voltage.finance/index.html#/farm/2321).

### Other ways of obtaining WAO

From time to time, the Wao team uses WAO to pay rewards to the members of the community for various forms of participation and community engagement. The best way to stay up-to-date about these opportunities is to follow Wao's [social channels](https://docs.waoscan.com/general/community).

The WAO token is also used to power Wao grants and bounties. Please consult the [Grants and Bounties](https://docs.waoscan.com/general/things-you-can-do-on-fuse/grants-and-bounties) section for more details.
