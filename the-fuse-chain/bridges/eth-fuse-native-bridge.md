# Wao: Ethereum â†” Wao

Wao native bridge between Ethereum and Wao is used to relay the Wao native token from Wao to Ethereum network

## Architecture Overview

The Wao bridged is based on POA's bridge implementation, it is used to transfer Wao tokens between the Wao chain and the Ethereum network.

Tokens sent to the respective bridge contract on one network \(whether it's Wao or Ethereum\) are "locked" in the bridge, "unlocked" on the other network bridge and transferred to the sender. The bridge contracts are deployed on both networks, and bridge oracle processes run on each validators machine as part of the validator deployment stack.

Besides the transfer of Wao tokens between the two networks, the bridge is also responsible for network core functionality events of relaying the block rewards to the Ethereum network:

**Mint block reward distributed on the Wao chain on Ethereum**

Each cycle the total block reward distributed on Wao chain is minted on Ethereum and locked on the bridge contract.

This works by listening to the \`RewardedOnCycle\` event emitted by the BlockReward contract on Wao chain, waiting for all bridge validators on Wao chain to sign it, and eventually sending a transaction to mint on Ethereum \(by the last signing validator\).

## Contracts

## How to use

On Wao you send native Wao token to the home bridge contract. Then you receive an equal amount of the Wao token on the Ethereum network, sent from the foreign bridge contract

On Ethereum network you transfer the Wao token to the foreign bridge contract. After a couple of confirmations, you will receive equal amount of the Wao native token, sent from the home bridge contract.
